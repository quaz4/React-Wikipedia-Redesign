# React Wikipedia Redesign

## What?
A redesign of the wikipedia homepage that currently looks a little dated.

## Why?
Wikipedia hasn't changed its look in a very long time, so its a prime target for modernisation.
So I decided that it would be good practice for both my design and front end skills to make a quick mock.
